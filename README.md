# Purpose Of Project

In early 2021 I wanted to learn how to use SQL in order to get myself ready for the job market. Having practiced a few SELECT statements, I realized that my understanding of databases, apart from SQL, was minimal. Instead of finding a database to practice SQL with, I opted to create my own so that I could go a bit further than studying SQL. I found the 2020 Stack Overflow Developer Survey mashed together in a large CSV file with minimal structure and an abundance of relationships --- this would be a great opportunity to create my first relational database from something that was unstructured and required *a lot* of data processing.

# Lessons Learned

1. Testing needs to be a top priority.
    - The code I have written here is not large by any stretch of the imagination, but ofen I found myself reasoning too much about my code. I am glad I keep a pen and paper by my side at all times when I code, but only upon reflection do I see how much time I can save by writing tests as my code evolves, and I along with it. More horrifying was setting up a new computer and running the code on a new system. On my new system the code broke immediately and I had to reason why it broke, but having adequate testing could have told me that much earlier. Perhaps a hard lesson learned, but a lesson learned indeed.
3. Start Git early and plan contributions as commits instead of just writing code.
    - I knew that version control was important, but I don't think I fully appreciated how important it is at the start of this project until it started getting bigger. I began to track the project near the end, and it caused several problems for me as I got more familiar with the tool. In hindsight, I realized that I can use Git as a means of organizing and planning the work I do in the future by planning work as commits. This will serve not only to organize my code, but my project management skills as they relate to software development.
5. Begin writing a ReadME.md early on instead of at the end.
    - This should have been a no brainer, but I focused too much on coding that occasionally I forgot to write about it. Even then, this will require a bit more research moving forward to understand what good documentation practices look like. 

#### Not the most beautiful respository out there, but I am proud of it as my first.
