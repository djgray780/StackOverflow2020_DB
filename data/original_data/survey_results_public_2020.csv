"The tables listed immediately above are exactly the same from the tab Creating Initial Entities. The goal of this tab (Editing Tables Round 1) was to turn the multiple answer attributed into a separate table.

 For example, recall that for ""Dev Type"" a respondent could have selected multiple choices. It seemed fitting, then, that ""Dev Type"" should certainly be its own table. What would have happened in the case that ""Dev Type"" was left under the initial ""EXPERIENCE TABLE"" from above? Well, then each ID associated with ""Dev Type"" would be entered as a list. But if we were interested in a query like ""How many males from Canada are Database Administrators or Back-End Developers"", then we might run into problems because we would need to access every list for Canadian males and then somehow extract these two pieces of information from everyones lists. This seems wildly inefficient, so it deserved its own table.
